= Lab: Understanding and Using Helm Hooks

== Objective

In this lab, you will:
* Learn about Helm hooks and how they can be used to extend chart functionality.
* Create a Helm chart with hooks.
* Verify the execution of hooks during the Helm lifecycle.

== Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, ensure you have the following:
* Minikube installed and running.
* `kubectl` and `Helm` installed and configured.
* Basic understanding of Helm and Kubernetes concepts.

== Lab Steps

=== Step 1: Start Minikube

Ensure that Minikube is running:

[source,bash]
----
minikube start
----

Verify that the Minikube cluster is active:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl cluster-info
----

=== Step 2: Create a New Helm Chart

Create a new Helm chart named `hook-demo`:

[source,bash]
----
helm create hook-demo
----

Change into the `hook-demo` directory:

[source,bash]
----
cd hook-demo
----

The `templates/` directory contains files that define Kubernetes resources. We will add hooks here.

=== Step 3: Create a Pre-Install Hook

Helm hooks allow you to run scripts or commands at different points in the Helm release lifecycle. We'll create a Pre-Install hook that runs before any Kubernetes resources are installed.

.Create a Pre-Install Hook
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: pre-install-job
  labels:
    app: hook-demo
  annotations:
    "helm.sh/hook": pre-install
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pre-install
        image: busybox
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo Pre-Install Hook: Preparing environment']
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 1
----

Save this as `templates/pre-install-job.yaml`.

This job will run a simple command as a Helm Pre-Install hook. The annotation `"helm.sh/hook": pre-install` defines this behavior.

=== Step 4: Create a Post-Install Hook

Next, create a Post-Install hook that runs after all Kubernetes resources have been created.

.Create a Post-Install Hook
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: post-install-job
  labels:
    app: hook-demo
  annotations:
    "helm.sh/hook": post-install
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: post-install
        image: busybox
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo Post-Install Hook: Setup complete']
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 1
----

Save this as `templates/post-install-job.yaml`.

This job will execute a command after the Helm chart's resources are installed.

=== Step 5: Install the Helm Chart

Now, install the Helm chart and observe the hooks in action.

.Install the `hook-demo` Chart
[source,bash]
----
helm install my-hook-demo .
----

During installation, you should see the hooks running.

.Verify the Hook Jobs
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get jobs
kubectl logs job/pre-install-job
kubectl logs job/post-install-job
----

The output should confirm that both the Pre-Install and Post-Install hooks ran successfully.

=== Step 6: Verify the Output

To ensure that the hooks worked as expected, verify the logs from both jobs:

.View Pre-Install Hook Logs
[source,bash]
----
kubectl logs job/pre-install-job
----

The output should be:
----
Pre-Install Hook: Preparing environment
----

.View Post-Install Hook Logs
[source,bash]
----
kubectl logs job/post-install-job
----

The output should be:
----
Post-Install Hook: Setup complete
----

These logs confirm that the hooks executed correctly during the Helm chart installation.

=== Step 7: Uninstall the Helm Chart

Uninstall the Helm chart and verify that no resources are left behind:

[source,bash]
----
helm uninstall my-hook-demo
kubectl get jobs
----

All jobs should be deleted as part of the Helm uninstall process.

=== Step 8: Clean Up

Remove any remaining resources and return to the original directory:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete jobs --all
cd ..
rm -rf hook-demo
----

== Explanation

* *Helm Hooks:* Helm hooks enable chart developers to execute commands at specific points in a release's lifecycle, such as before or after installation, upgrade, or deletion. This adds flexibility to manage complex deployments.
* *Pre-Install Hook:* This hook runs before any resources are created, allowing you to prepare the environment.
* *Post-Install Hook:* This hook runs after all resources are created, ideal for completing final setup steps or notifications.

== Verification

Ensure the following to verify the lab:
1. Both Pre-Install and Post-Install hooks ran successfully, as confirmed by their logs.
2. The Helm chart was installed, the hooks executed, and the chart was uninstalled without leaving any orphaned resources.

This lab demonstrates how to leverage Helm hooks to manage and automate tasks in a Kubernetes deployment, showcasing their powerful integration into the Helm lifecycle.
