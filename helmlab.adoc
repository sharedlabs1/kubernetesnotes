= Lab: Exploring the Advantages of Helm in Kubernetes

== Objective

In this lab, you will:
* Deploy an application to Kubernetes manually without using Helm.
* Identify the disadvantages of manual deployment.
* Implement the same deployment using Helm.
* Understand the advantages Helm provides for Kubernetes deployments.

== Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, ensure you have the following:
* Minikube installed and running.
* `kubectl` installed and configured.
* Basic understanding of Kubernetes objects.

== Lab Steps

=== Step 1: Install Helm

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, and you'll need it installed before proceeding with the lab.

.Install Helm
[source,bash]
----
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
----

.Verify the Installation
[source,bash]
----
helm version
----

You should see the Helm version details if the installation was successful.

=== Step 2: Manual Deployment without Helm

First, we will manually deploy a simple Nginx application to Kubernetes without using Helm.

.Create the Deployment YAML
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.21.1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
----

.Create the Service YAML
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: NodePort
----

Apply the Deployment and Service manifests:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
----

Check the status of the deployment:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
----

=== Step 3: Identify Disadvantages of Manual Deployment

When deploying without Helm, the following disadvantages are observed:

1. **Complexity:** Each Kubernetes object (Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, etc.) must be managed individually.

2. **Repeatability:** Repeating the deployment across different environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) requires manual changes to YAML files.

3. **Lack of Versioning:** Changes to the deployment are hard to track and version.

4. **Maintenance:** Updating or rolling back requires modifying multiple YAML files manually.

These challenges can lead to errors and make the process difficult to manage, especially as the number of Kubernetes objects increases.

=== Step 4: Implement the Same Deployment Using Helm

Now, we will use Helm to deploy the same Nginx application.

.Create a Helm Chart
[source,bash]
----
helm create nginx-chart
----

This command generates a basic Helm chart structure under the `nginx-chart` directory. The following files are of interest:

* `values.yaml` - Contains the default configurations for the chart.

* `templates/` - Contains the Kubernetes manifests that Helm will manage.

.Edit `values.yaml` to configure the deployment
[source,yaml]
----
# values.yaml

replicaCount: 2

image:
  repository: nginx
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  tag: "1.21.1"

service:
  type: NodePort
  port: 80

ingress:
  enabled: false

resources: {}

autoscaling:
  enabled: false

nodeSelector: {}

tolerations: []

affinity: {}
----

.Deploy the Application Using Helm
[source,bash]
----
helm install my-nginx nginx-chart
----

Verify the deployment:

[source,bash]
----
helm list
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get services
----

=== Step 5: Add `kubectl` Manifests

Kubernetes manifests can include ConfigMaps, Secrets, and other custom configurations. Hereâ€™s how to add a ConfigMap and Secret to the Nginx application.

.Create a ConfigMap YAML
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: nginx-config
  namespace: default
data:
  index.html: |
    <html>
    <head><title>Welcome to Nginx</title></head>
    <body>
    <h1>Success! The Nginx server is configured correctly.</h1>
    </body>
    </html>
----

.Create a Secret YAML
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: nginx-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=   # base64 encoded value for "admin"
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ= # base64 encoded value for "password"
----

.Apply the ConfigMap and Secret
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f nginx-config.yaml
kubectl apply -f nginx-secret.yaml
----

You can now update the Nginx deployment to use the ConfigMap and Secret.

.Update the Deployment YAML to use ConfigMap and Secret
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.21.1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: nginx-html
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
        env:
        - name: NGINX_USERNAME
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: nginx-secret
              key: username
        - name: NGINX_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: nginx-secret
              key: password
      volumes:
      - name: nginx-html
        configMap:
          name: nginx-config
----

Apply the updated deployment:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
----

Verify that the ConfigMap and Secret are used correctly:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl describe pod <nginx-pod-name>
kubectl exec -it <nginx-pod-name> -- cat /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
kubectl exec -it <nginx-pod-name> -- env | grep NGINX
----

=== Step 6: Advantages of Using Helm

By using Helm, the following advantages are observed:

1. **Simplicity:** Helm packages all Kubernetes objects into a single chart, simplifying the deployment process.
2. **Parameterization:** `values.yaml` allows easy configuration changes without editing multiple YAML files.
3. **Repeatability:** Helm enables consistent deployments across environments with environment-specific values.
4. **Versioning:** Helm tracks the history of releases, allowing easy rollback to previous versions.
5. **Maintenance:** Updates are managed with simple Helm commands (`helm upgrade`, `helm rollback`).

=== Step 7: Clean Up

Remove the Helm release:

[source,bash]
----
helm uninstall my-nginx
----

Remove the manually created resources (if still present):

[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete -f nginx-deployment.yaml
kubectl delete -f nginx-service.yaml
kubectl delete -f nginx-config.yaml
kubectl delete -f nginx-secret.yaml
----

== Explanation

* *Manual Deployment:* Requires creating and managing individual YAML files for each Kubernetes object, leading to complexity and a higher risk of errors.

* *Helm Deployment:* Helm bundles Kubernetes objects into a single, manageable chart. It simplifies deployment, improves repeatability, supports versioning, and makes maintenance easier.

* *ConfigMap and Secret:* ConfigMaps and Secrets are standard ways to inject configuration data into your Kubernetes applications. Helm simplifies their management and integration into deployments.

== Verification

Ensure the following to verify the lab:
1. The manual deployment works but requires multiple steps and files.
2. The Helm deployment simplifies the process into a single command with easier updates and rollbacks.
3. Proper cleanup is performed after the lab.

This lab demonstrates the power and flexibility of Helm in managing Kubernetes deployments, highlighting how it reduces complexity and improves efficiency while handling configuration data effectively.
