* Helm installed on your local machine.

### Step 1: Create a Kubernetes Deployment Manually

Create a `deployment.yaml` file:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.17.1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
----

Apply the deployment:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
----

### Step 2: Verify the Deployment
