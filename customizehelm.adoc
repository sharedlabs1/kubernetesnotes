= Lab: Customizing an Existing Helm Chart for a Desired Outcome

== Objective

In this lab, you will:
* Learn how to customize an existing Helm chart to achieve a specific outcome.
* Understand how to modify `values.yaml` and Helm templates.
* Verify the deployment to ensure the customizations are applied correctly.

== Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, ensure you have the following:
* Minikube installed and running.
* `kubectl` and `Helm` installed and configured.
* Basic understanding of Helm and Kubernetes.

== Lab Steps

=== Step 1: Install a Sample Helm Chart

For this lab, we will use the official Nginx Helm chart provided by Bitnami as our base chart.

.Add the Bitnami Repository
[source,bash]
----
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
----

.Install the Nginx Helm Chart
[source,bash]
----
helm install my-nginx bitnami/nginx
----

.Verify the Deployment
[source,bash]
----
helm list
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get services
----

At this point, Nginx is deployed using the default settings provided by the Helm chart.

=== Step 2: Identify Customization Requirements

Suppose we want to:
1. Change the Nginx replica count from 1 to 3.
2. Expose the service on a different NodePort.
3. Modify the default Nginx welcome page.

These customizations require changes to the Helm chart's `values.yaml` file and possibly its templates.

=== Step 3: Customize the Helm Chart

To achieve the desired outcome, we will customize the Helm chart by overriding the default values.

.Create a Custom `values.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
replicaCount: 3

service:
  type: NodePort
  nodePorts:
    http: 32080

ingress:
  enabled: false

resources: {}

autoscaling:
  enabled: false

nodeSelector: {}

tolerations: []

affinity: {}

nginxServerBlock: |
  server {
      listen 80;
      server_name localhost;
      root /opt/bitnami/nginx/html;
      index index.html;
      location / {
          return 200 'Welcome to the Customized Nginx Server!';
          add_header Content-Type text/plain;
      }
  }
----

This custom `values.yaml` file:
* Increases the replica count to 3.
* Sets the NodePort for the Nginx service to 32080.
* Customizes the Nginx welcome page.

=== Step 4: Apply the Customizations

Using the custom `values.yaml`, install or upgrade the Helm release.

.Apply the Custom Values
[source,bash]
----
helm upgrade --install my-nginx bitnami/nginx -f custom-values.yaml
----

Verify the deployment:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
----

Confirm the replica count:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get deployment my-nginx -o=jsonpath='{.spec.replicas}'
----

Check the NodePort and access the custom welcome page:

.Get the NodePort
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get svc my-nginx -o=jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}'
----

.Access the Custom Nginx Page
[source,bash]
----
curl http://$(minikube ip):32080
----

You should see the customized message: `Welcome to the Customized Nginx Server!`

=== Step 5: Verify the Changes

To ensure the customizations are correctly applied:
* Verify the Nginx Deployment has 3 replicas.
* Confirm the service is exposed on port 32080.
* Ensure the Nginx server returns the customized welcome message.

=== Step 6: Clean Up

Remove the Helm release:

[source,bash]
----
helm uninstall my-nginx
----

== Explanation

* *Helm Chart Customization:* By modifying the `values.yaml` file, you can easily change configurations such as replica count, service type, and even application-specific settings like Nginx configuration.
* *Overriding Default Values:* The `helm upgrade --install` command applies the custom values, allowing you to adapt a chart to different environments or requirements.
* *Templates and Values:* Helm charts use Go templates for manifest generation. Customizing these templates via `values.yaml` enables flexible and reusable deployments.

== Verification

Ensure the following to verify the lab:
1. The replica count is successfully updated to 3.
2. The service is exposed on the specified NodePort.
3. The customized Nginx welcome page is accessible.

This lab demonstrates how to effectively customize an existing Helm chart to meet specific deployment requirements, illustrating the power and flexibility Helm provides in managing Kubernetes applications.
