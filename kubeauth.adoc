= Lab: Authentication and Authorization using Minikube

== Objective

In this lab, you will:
* Learn how to configure and implement authentication and authorization in a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube.
* Understand how to create users, roles, and role bindings.
* Verify the implementation by testing access controls.

== Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, ensure you have the following:
* Minikube installed and running.
* `kubectl` installed and configured.
* Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts.

== Lab Steps

=== Step 1: Start Minikube

Start your Minikube cluster if it is not already running.

[source,bash]
----
minikube start
----

Verify that the Minikube cluster is running:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl cluster-info
----

=== Step 2: Create a New Namespace

We will create a new namespace called `auth-demo` where we will configure authentication and authorization.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl create namespace auth-demo
----

Verify the namespace creation:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get namespaces
----

=== Step 3: Create a Service Account

Service accounts are used by processes running inside pods to interact with the Kubernetes API. We'll create a service account that will simulate a user account.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl create serviceaccount demo-user -n auth-demo
----

List the service accounts to verify creation:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get serviceaccounts -n auth-demo
----

=== Step 4: Generate a Token for the Service Account

Generate a token that will be used for authentication.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl create token demo-user -n auth-demo
----

The output will display the token, which will be used later for authentication.

=== Step 5: Create a Role and RoleBinding

Create a role that defines the permissions and a role binding that assigns this role to the service account.

.Create a Role to Allow Listing Pods
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: auth-demo
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
----

Apply the role:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f pod-reader-role.yaml
----

.Create a RoleBinding to Bind the Role to the Service Account
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods-binding
  namespace: auth-demo
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: demo-user
  namespace: auth-demo
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
----

Apply the role binding:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f rolebinding.yaml
----

=== Step 6: Test Authentication and Authorization

Create a kubeconfig file for the `demo-user` to simulate the user accessing the cluster with the assigned permissions.

.Create a `demo-user` Kubeconfig File
[source,bash]
----
kubectl config set-credentials demo-user --token=<TOKEN>
kubectl config set-context demo-user-context --cluster=minikube --namespace=auth-demo --user=demo-user
kubectl config use-context demo-user-context
----

Replace `<TOKEN>` with the token generated earlier.

.Test Access to Pods (Allowed)
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pods
----

.Test Access to Services (Denied)
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get services
----

The first command should succeed, while the second should fail, demonstrating that the `demo-user` only has access to list pods as per the role defined.

=== Step 7: Clean Up

Reset the kubeconfig context back to the default context:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl config use-context minikube
----

Remove the resources created:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete namespace auth-demo
kubectl delete role pod-reader -n auth-demo
kubectl delete rolebinding read-pods-binding -n auth-demo
----

== Explanation

* *Service Account:* In Kubernetes, a service account provides an identity for processes running in a pod to interact with the API server.
* *Role and RoleBinding:* Roles define a set of permissions, and role bindings assign these roles to users or service accounts. This lab uses a role to allow the `demo-user` to list pods and demonstrates how role bindings enforce these permissions.
* *Authentication vs. Authorization:* Authentication verifies the identity of a user or service account, while authorization determines what actions they are permitted to take.

== Verification

Ensure the following to verify the lab:
1. The `demo-user` can list pods in the `auth-demo` namespace but cannot list services.
2. The authentication using the generated token is successful.
3. Role and RoleBinding are correctly applied to enforce access control.

This lab demonstrates how to set up and verify basic authentication and authorization using service accounts, roles, and role bindings in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Minikube.
