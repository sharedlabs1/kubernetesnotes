= Lab: Using Artifact Hub to Customize and Deploy a Helm Chart

== Objective

In this lab, you will:
* Learn how to find a Helm chart on Artifact Hub.
* Download and customize an existing Helm chart.
* Deploy the customized Helm chart to a Kubernetes cluster.
* Verify the deployment and ensure the customizations are applied.

== Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, ensure you have the following:
* Minikube installed and running.
* `kubectl` and `Helm` installed and configured.
* Basic understanding of Kubernetes and Helm.
* Access to the internet to browse Artifact Hub.

== Lab Steps

=== Step 1: Browse Artifact Hub

1. Open your web browser and go to https://artifacthub.io/.
2. In the search bar, type `nginx` and press Enter.
3. Browse the results and select a Helm chart for NGINX that you would like to customize, such as the `bitnami/nginx` chart.
4. Take note of the chartâ€™s repository URL.

=== Step 2: Add the Helm Repository

Add the Helm repository to your local environment:

[source,bash]
----
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
----

Verify that the repository has been added:

[source,bash]
----
helm search repo nginx
----

You should see the `bitnami/nginx` chart listed.

=== Step 3: Download the Helm Chart

Download the Helm chart to your local environment for customization:

[source,bash]
----
helm pull bitnami/nginx --untar
----

This command downloads and extracts the `nginx` chart into a directory called `nginx`.

Change to the chart directory:

[source,bash]
----
cd nginx
----

=== Step 4: Customize the Helm Chart

Open the `values.yaml` file in a text editor to customize the chart.

[source,yaml]
----
## NGINX specific configuration parameters
image:
  registry: docker.io
  repository: bitnami/nginx
  tag: 1.21.3

service:
  type: NodePort
  port: 80

resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 200m
    memory: 256Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi

replicaCount: 2
----

For this lab, make the following customizations:
1. Set `replicaCount` to `3`.
2. Change the service `type` from `NodePort` to `LoadBalancer`.
3. Adjust resource limits and requests as needed for your environment.

.Save and close the file.

=== Step 5: Deploy the Customized Helm Chart

Deploy the customized chart to your Minikube cluster:

[source,bash]
----
helm install my-custom-nginx .
----

Helm will deploy the chart using your custom `values.yaml` settings.

=== Step 6: Verify the Deployment

Check the status of the deployed resources:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc
----

You should see three NGINX pods running, and the service should be of type `LoadBalancer`.

If Minikube does not support `LoadBalancer`, expose the service using a `NodePort` instead:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl expose deployment my-custom-nginx-nginx --type=NodePort --name=my-nginx-service
----

Retrieve the Minikube IP and access the NGINX service:

[source,bash]
----
minikube service my-nginx-service --url
----

Open the URL in your browser to confirm the deployment is successful.

=== Step 7: Clean Up

Uninstall the Helm release and delete the chart directory:

[source,bash]
----
helm uninstall my-custom-nginx
cd ..
rm -rf nginx
----

== Explanation

* *Artifact Hub:* Artifact Hub is a web-based application that allows you to find, install, and publish Kubernetes packages (Helm charts, operators, etc.).
* *Customizing Helm Charts:* Customizing a Helm chart involves editing the `values.yaml` file, where you can override default settings to tailor the deployment to your needs.
* *Deploying Custom Charts:* After customization, the chart is deployed using Helm, and Kubernetes resources are created based on your modified settings.

== Verification

Ensure the following to verify the lab:
1. The Helm chart was successfully customized with your changes applied.
2. The deployment has three NGINX pods running.
3. The NGINX service is accessible via the provided Minikube IP.

This lab demonstrates how to leverage Artifact Hub to find and customize Helm charts, making it easier to deploy applications tailored to specific requirements.
